        I'm a first-year MS CS student with no particular research interests yet. Neither do I have any real research experience. <br>
        Before this, I was a software engineer at Uber for four years, so I have confidence in my ability to code any idea we have and debug any issues we encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reinforcement learning (for games, or otherwise)</li>
        <li>LLM Architecture, analysis, and experimentation</li>
        <li>Domain-specific Neural network architectures (speech, music, images, etc.)</li>
        <li>Theoretical analysis of neural networks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I have not yet teamed up with anyone.
